# Machine Learning in Catalysis

## üî¨ About This Project

This repository reflects my ongoing interest in the **application of machine learning algorithms in chemistry**, with a particular focus on **catalysis**. The goal is to explore how data-driven models can accelerate catalyst discovery, improve reaction condition predictions, and help interpret complex mechanistic pathways.

## üß† Why Machine Learning in Catalysis?

Catalysis plays a central role in chemical manufacturing, energy production, and sustainable chemistry. Traditional trial-and-error approaches in catalyst design are time-consuming and expensive. Machine learning offers a powerful set of tools to:

- Predict catalytic activity
- Classify reaction outcomes based on structural descriptors
- Extract hidden patterns from high-throughput screening data

## ‚öóÔ∏è Reactions of Interest

Some catalytically important reactions that are particularly compelling for ML-based studies include:

- **Oxygeb Reduction Reaction** using transition metal complex solid solutions
- **CO‚ÇÇ Reduction** to value-added chemicals (e.g., methanol, formic acid)
